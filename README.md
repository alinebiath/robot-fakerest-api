# robot-test-api-rest

Small demonstration of a  project to automate API Rest tests using Robot Framework.

Robot Framework is a Python-based, extensible keyword-driven test automation framework for end-to-end acceptance testing and acceptance-test-driven development (ATDD). Read more: http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html

In this project I'm automating basic tests to access an API sever, executing the main requests like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
To do this, I used RequestsLibrary and Collections library to access and read responses from API REST server.</br>
API used as example: https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/ui/index#/
